# WHAT IS FARMDROP?

An online farmers market offering customers high quality, locally sourced food and drink direct from the Farmers and Artisans. Farmdrop promotes sustainable farming practices and aims to rekindle the forgotten relationship between the people who farms and craft fantastic produce, and the people who eat it.
