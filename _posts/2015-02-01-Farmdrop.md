# WHAT MAKES FARMDROP DIFFERENT?

Farmdropâ€™s mission is to promote local farmers and artisans who grow and craft fantastic produce, making fresher tastier food available to everyone. Naturally this meant building an e-commerce model around these producers sustainable practices.

Producers are compensated properly as they work the hardest, earning at least 70% of the total revenue compared to supermarket's 20%. Producers are also given a minimum of 2 days notice to prepare their orders so they can keep those carrots cosy in the ground until they are absolutely needed, reducing waste and offering fresher food.

Farmdrop then pack each customers order and send it out for delivery or pickup all within a 12 hour window.
